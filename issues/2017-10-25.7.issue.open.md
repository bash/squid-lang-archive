> Explain why one should use Ink (Why another markup format?)
Some ideas and reasons are already written down here: https://github.com/ink-markup/ink/blob/master/concept.txt#L3

Some reasons that I can think of right now:
- "Safer" compared to markdown (no inline HTML)
- Is not constrained to HTML (can in theory be serialized to any format)
