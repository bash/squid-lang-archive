[These dudes](https://github.com/sapo/Ink) had the name first. They use the same file extension and are also a markup language.

Squid is thematically similar and [not used for any language related projects](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=squid&type=).  
I propose to switch to the extension .sq, as it is [not used by anyone yet](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3A.sq&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=).

Plus, we get to use this cute fella: ðŸ¦‘
