# [\#34 Issue](https://github.com/squid-lang/squid/issues/34) `open`: Forced Line Breaks
**Labels**: `syntax`

I am proposing `\` before a line ending to force a line break.
Markdown uses two spaces, which is sometimes annoying because it's not directly visible when viewing the document in plain text.

```
This text will be separated \
by a newline.
```

## Open Questions

- How are forced line breaks at the end of a paragraph treated? Are they ignored?
  ```
  This text will be separated \
  by a newline. \  <<< What happens here?

  foo bar baz
  ```
