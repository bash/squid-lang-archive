# [\#25 Issue](https://github.com/squid-lang/squid/issues/25) `open`: Automatic Link Detection

## Label

The label for a link is generally the same as the URL itself.

We could however omit the protocol for web URLs  (`http://` or `https://`)  starting with `www.`.

## Protocols

In order to simplify link detection I think it makes sense to limit automatic link detection to the most common ones.

AsciiDoc does this too:
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#external-links

## Brackets

We need to have some heuristics around brackets (`{}`, `[]` and `()`).
The best approach I have seen so far is to include all brackets inside the URL if they're balanced.

**Example**
```
The Wikipedia article on the "Slow Loris" attack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)) is really interesting.
```

I am in favor of allowing the omitting of the protocol. I think it strikes a nice balance between being too strict, giving the user too much manual work, and being to lean, generating false positives.  
Also, I advise to not go any further with the allowed omission. If we allow only google.com, for instance, we are going to have a hard time figuring out what should be an URL and what shouldn't. I think in this regard, it's better to be a bit conservative.

What do you think of allowing URLs starting with www. to omit the protocol?

Speaking of being to lax: Look at how github linkifies `www.` ðŸ˜…

I think we need some additional heuristics around dots and (maybe) commas which might me at the end of an URL but are more likely part of the sentence than the URL

What kind of sensible URL has dots and commas at the end though?

I think that this should be in its own little section in the spec.
