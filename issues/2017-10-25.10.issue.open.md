I propose the following:

## Emphasis
```
**ðŸ“£ Attention:** We're having brunch **tomorrow at 10**.
More details to follow. *Please let us know if you can't come.*
```

## Strike Through

Never mind, we would love to see  some contributions!

I think we should adopt the following rules from the CommonMark spec:

http://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#delimiter-run

> A left-flanking delimiter run is a delimiter run that is (a) not followed by Unicode whitespace, and (b) not followed by a punctuation character, or preceded by Unicode whitespace or a punctuation character. For purposes of this definition, the beginning and the end of the line count as Unicode whitespace.

For purposes of this definition, the beginning and the end of the line count as Unicode whitespace.

**Update**: I have changed `_` (emphasis) to `*`, and `*` (strong emphasis) to `**`. This makes the underscore (`_`) available again.

It's also really nice from a logical point of view:

- one asterisk (`*`) = _emphasis_ (italics)
- two asterisks (`**`) = **strong emphasis** (bold)
- three asterisks (`***`) = **_ultra emphasis_** (bold + italics)

For now we won't define any syntax for underlining text.

There are very few good use cases for underlining text anyways. 
It's also not really encouraged. See: https://practicaltypography.com/underlining.html

One possible valid use-case would be when presenting a filled out form.
Those usually have empty lines where you need to fill in information, which will afterward look like it's underlined.

Not that I'm advocating for underlining text, just providing one example.
